# Data-Products
This program allows a user to do linear regressions on the mtcars dataset. First, the user simply picks the dependent (outcome) variable against which he wants to perform a linear regression. Then the checkboxes are automatically updated with the names of the variables (minus the dependent variable). When a user checks the independent variables, the results of a linear regression are shown on the screen.
